WordPress Subordinate Post
===================

This class extends default functionality of register_post_type to include children post types with WordPress.

Add 'parent' argument to hook custom post type as a child (subordinate) post type. Or add 'children' argument (accepts string/array) for setting the registered post type as a parent post type to the specified post types.
